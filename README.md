# ðŸ“¡ Trial on LoRaWAN Downlink Localization: A Gateway Beaconing Approach

This NS-3 simulation implements a **LoRaWAN localization mechanism** using **gateway beaconing**. Gateways periodically transmit **downlink beacons**, and End Devices (EDs) estimate their position using **RSSI-based trilateration**. Gaussian noise is added to RSSI measurements to emulate real-world variability.
